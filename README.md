# AUTOMOBILE-DATA-ANALYSIS
## Introduction
Data analysis project on the automotive industry with React in the frontend and Flask in the backend.<br/>
Car Data Analysis is a ReactJS based web application with a Flask based backend. It has Three components.<br/>
* Front-Page:Univariate Analysis(For single variable)<br/>Bivariate Analysis(For two variable)<br/>Correlation(to get relationship between two variable)<br/>Most Common Specification 
* Company Analysis:Price Analysis(Analysing power for different variables like Fuel Type,Drive Train, etc)<br/>Power Analysis(variation of power with cc, etc)<br/>Mileage Analysis(Variation of Mileage with Fuel Type ,Engine cc, etc)<br/>Body Type Analysis<br/>Fuel Type Analysis
* Ex-Showroom-Price Prediction:Predicting the Expected Showroom price of a new car.
## Technologies used
* ReactJS: React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.
* react-chartjs-2 : React components for Chart.js, the most popular charting library.
* Styled Components: Styled-components is a popular library that is used to style React applications. It allows you to build custom components by writing actual CSS in your JavaScript.
